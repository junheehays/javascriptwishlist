# Overview

Through this project, I would like to familiarize myself to javascript, HTML, CSS by building a webpage where I can create a wishlist.

When a user add Item name and the link, the program will add the item to the wishlist. When the user clicks on a wishlist item, it will move to bought item (Mine now). When the user clicks on the "X" button, he/she can delete the item from a list.

This software will help people track the items they want to get and which one of those items they have bought.
